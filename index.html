            <p>This is my world well at least part of it. My name is Alberto Santiago and I use He/Him pronouns. I was born in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moca,_Dominican_Republic">Moca, Dominican Republic</a> but raised in New York City. I am a third year student at the University of Wisconsin Madison currently looking at persuing a degree in Information Science.</p>

            <p>I love my plants and eventually want every inch of my house to be covered in them.</p>

            <p>When I have the budget, time, and energy I enjoy fashion.</p>
